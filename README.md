# Advent of Code

![](https://github.com/Clement-Lelievre/lewagon_x_aoc/blob/master/aoc.png)

This repo holds my work on advent of code. I started solving thise puzzles in 2021, in Python,
primarily because it was a really fun way to improve my Python skills and brush up on my OOP, data structures,
and algorithms knowledge.


## Why the name `lewagon_x_aoc` ?

This is because I attended a coding bootcamp called Le Wagon, that has internally its own private leaderboard for advent of code and a dedicated website called like this, so when I set up my repo I chose that name

## Where is your input data?

My inputs are (quite grossly) pasted directly in the modules, instead of put in a separate file. The sample inputs provided are usually used in unit tests, although not in a dedicated file and with pytest; only using an 
```python
assert
```
statement

## what about the commit messages?

Initially they contained mostly comments about success or failure, e.g. "solved day 18" then I figured it'd be more instructive to name the skills I worked on a a specific problem, so towards the end commit messages tend to be more descriptive of the skills used, e.g. "Priority queue, inheritance, sets"
