# Advent of Code

![](https://github.com/Clement-Lelievre/lewagon_x_aoc/blob/master/aoc.png)

This repo holds my work on advent of code. I started solving thise puzzles in 2021, in Python,
primarily because it was a really fun way to improve my Python skills and brush up on my OOP, data structures,
and algorithms knowledge.

Note: my inputs are (quite grossly) pasted directly in the modules, instead of put in a separate file.
